Computree meta repository
======================
Computree is a processing platform for 3D points clouds, obtained with LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) or photogrammetry. It aims to regroup algoritms for forests scenes analysis, in order to extract data on structure of trees and stands. It is managed by the [ONF](http://www.onf.fr), in partnership with the [ENSAM in Cluny](http://www.ensam.fr/fr/centres_et_instituts/centre_cluny).

This meta-project includes other repositories for convenience. Instructions to compile and use this software are available on the official website: http://computree.onf.fr
